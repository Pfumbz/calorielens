# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CalorieLens is a Flutter-based AI nutrition tracking app (Android primary, iOS future). Users photograph or describe meals; the app uses Claude Haiku to analyse nutrition and provides an AI coaching chat. The backend runs on Supabase (Edge Functions + PostgreSQL + Auth).

**Current target:** Android (debug builds via `flutter run`, release via Codemagic CI/CD at github.com/Pfumbz/calorielens).

---

## Commands

```bash
# Run on connected Android device
flutter run

# If build fails with "Unable to delete directory mergeDebugAssets" (Windows file lock):
Stop-Process -Name "java" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build
flutter run

# Get/update packages
flutter pub get

# Analyse for lint errors
flutter analyze

# Build release APK (prefer Codemagic; local fallback):
flutter build apk --release
```

There are no automated tests in this project yet.

## Architecture

### Request Flow for AI Features

All AI calls route through a single decision point in `BackendService`:

```
AppState.backend (getter)
  └── BackendService(byokApiKey: state.apiKey or null)
        ├── BYOK key present → AnthropicService (direct Anthropic API, no limits)
        └── No BYOK key     → Supabase Edge Functions (rate-limited, key held server-side)
              ├── /functions/v1/scan-image  (10 free scans/day enforced server-side)
              ├── /functions/v1/scan-text
              └── /functions/v1/chat        (15 free messages/day enforced server-side)
```

The Edge Functions are TypeScript/Deno and live in `supabase/functions/`. Each function: verifies the Supabase JWT → checks the `usage` table for daily rate limits → calls Anthropic → increments the counter. The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is stored as a Supabase secret, never in client code.

### State Management

Single `AppState` (`lib/app_state.dart`) extends `ChangeNotifier`, provided at root via `provider`. It is the single source of truth for:
- Local diary entries, profile, water, calorie goal (loaded from `StorageService`/SharedPreferences)
- Auth state (`_supabaseUser` from Supabase)
- Backend rate-limit cache (`_backendScansToday`, `_backendChatsToday`)

**Offline-first pattern:** Local SharedPreferences is always written first. Cloud sync (`SupabaseService`) is fire-and-forget via the `unawaited()` helper at the bottom of `app_state.dart`. On sign-in, `onSignIn()` triggers `_migrateLocalDataToCloud()` (one-time) then `_refreshFromCloud()`.

### Auth & Navigation Flow

```
SplashScreen (2.4s animated)
  └── AuthGate (StatefulWidget, listens to Supabase auth stream)
        ├── signed in      → AppShell
        ├── _guestMode=true → AppShell (set by LoginScreen callback)
        └── not signed in  → LoginScreen(onContinueAsGuest: () => setState(_guestMode=true))
```

`AuthGate` is a `StatefulWidget` with a `_guestMode` bool. Guest mode uses local-only storage with a 3 scan/day limit (enforced by `StorageService.canScan`). Signed-in users get 10 scans/day enforced server-side.

**Sign-in from Settings:** `SettingsScreen` pushes `LoginScreen()` without the `onContinueAsGuest` callback (which hides the guest button when opened mid-session).

### Data Layer

| Layer | File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Local persistence | `lib/services/storage_service.dart` | SharedPreferences singleton — diary, profile, scan counts, API key |
| Cloud | `lib/services/supabase_service.dart` | Supabase client wrapper — profile sync, diary sync, usage fetch |
| Auth | `lib/services/auth_service.dart` | Email/password + Google Sign-In via Supabase Auth |
| AI proxy | `lib/services/backend_service.dart` | Routes to BYOK or Edge Functions; handles 429 rate-limit errors |
| Direct AI | `lib/services/anthropic_service.dart` | Only used by BackendService when BYOK key is present |

### Supabase Schema (already deployed)

Three tables in `supabase/schema.sql`:
- `profiles` — one row per user; auto-created by a trigger on `auth.users` insert
- `usage` — `(user_id, date)` primary key; `scan_count` and `chat_count` columns
- `diary_entries` — cloud-synced meal log; `(user_id, date)` indexed

Row Level Security is enabled; users can only read/write their own rows.

### UI / Theming

All colours are in `lib/theme.dart` as `CLColors` static constants (e.g. `CLColors.accent` = orange `#D07830`, `CLColors.bg` = near-black `#0C0B09`). The theme is fully dark. Never hardcode colours in widgets.

### Pricing / Localisation

`lib/utils/pricing.dart` uses `Platform.localeName` to detect country and return localised subscription price (e.g. ZAR for South Africa, USD fallback). The `PricingInfo` map covers ZA, NG, KE, GH, EG, TZ, UG, GB, DE, FR, CA, BR, AU, NZ, IN, SG, AE, MX, US. Upgrade modal and Settings screen both read from `getLocalPricing()`.

## Key Decisions & Constraints

- **Windows file locking:** Gradle daemons frequently lock `build/app/intermediates/assets/debug/mergeDebugAssets` on Windows. The fix is always: kill Java processes → delete `build/` → re-run. Restarting the PC is the nuclear option.
- **No `supabase_flutter` URL property on client:** Use `SupabaseConfig.supabaseUrl` (the constant) not `SupabaseService.client.supabaseUrl` — the latter doesn't exist in v2 of the library.
- **Google Sign-In not yet functional:** Requires SHA-1 fingerprint registered in Google Cloud Console + `google-services.json` placed at `android/app/google-services.json`. Error code 10 = DEVELOPER_ERROR = missing SHA-1.
- **iOS not yet configured:** Requires Apple Developer Program enrolment ($99/year). iOS build from Codemagic produces an unsigned `Runner.app.zip` that cannot run on a real device.
- **Email confirmation:** Supabase has email confirmation enabled by default. Disable it in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email → toggle off "Confirm email" for better UX.
- **Scan limit display in ScanScreen:** The header pill shows `scansRemainingToday` for signed-in users, "BYOK" for API key users, "Guest" for unauthenticated — it uses `state.isSignedIn` and `state.hasApiKey`.
- **`unawaited()` helper:** Defined at the bottom of `app_state.dart`. Used for all fire-and-forget cloud sync calls to prevent unhandled Future exceptions from crashing the UI.

## Supabase Configuration

Credentials are in `lib/services/supabase_service.dart` (`SupabaseConfig` class). The project URL is `https://qjyxdapbuszjtguyrtdk.supabase.co`. The anon key is already populated.

Edge Functions require the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret set in Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Secrets.

---

## Pending Work (as of last session)

1. **Google Sign-In setup** — get debug SHA-1 (`keytool -list -v -keystore "$env:USERPROFILE\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android`), register in Google Cloud Console, download `google-services.json` to `android/app/`, enable Google provider in Supabase Auth.
2. **Disable Supabase email confirmation** — otherwise email sign-up requires clicking a link before sign-in works.
3. **End-to-end test** — sign in with the test email account, attempt an AI scan, check Edge Function logs in Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → select function → Logs tab.
4. **Push to GitHub → Codemagic rebuild** — all Phase 1 changes need a fresh cloud build to produce an installable APK.
5. **In-app purchases** — the upgrade modal UI exists (`lib/widgets/upgrade_modal.dart`) but no real payment processor is connected.
6. **Meal history screen** — currently only today's diary is shown; past days are stored locally but no UI to browse them.
7. **Barcode scanning** — not yet implemented.
